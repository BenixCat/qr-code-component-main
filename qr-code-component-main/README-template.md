## Overview

I done this without struglle but I know my code isn't perfect somehow I managed to done this. I want to strugle through solving these problems because whenever I feel I'm strugling with something just one day later or just a hour later I'm feeling proud of my self because I done something was feeling hard to me.

## My process

I made a div for all the elements in the HTML and I put elements in to div then I wraped my text into a info div then I wrote the CSS I put in to center with margin first i tried to use flex but grid felt easier so I used the grid box then made other things and I changed divs into semantic elements then finished

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
